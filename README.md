# OLX Code Challenge
I used a boilerplate react app that i created (you can check it in my github)

## Stack
- `Express` server to server the app, with some placeholder for API 
- `Webpack` to bundle the client code, this is being done on the server side. 
- `React` & `Redux` on the front end 
- `styled-components` for styling the app. 
- `eslint` for linting the code. 

## Runnning
`npm i && npm start` and then open `http://localhost:8080`
